This is a creative and ambitious idea with a clear technical direction. For the experiments, the two most important things to lock down early are how you will obtain ground truth QoE labels across different platforms and how you will normalize feature extraction so that Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music traffic are comparable. Without consistent labeling and a unified feature space, transfer learning results will be hard to interpret. Once those pieces are settled, your cross-platform experiments should give meaningful insight into what generalizes and what breaks.
